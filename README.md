# Brandobook

I used a book/reading theme for this social media application.

I didn't use any AI tools and I kept almost the entire thing within the two hour limit (except this README). I did spend some time before actually coding working on the idea, colors, and very basic napkin wireframing. I hope that's okay. It wasn't more than 30 minutes or so.

Well, "didn't use any AI tools" isn't entirely accurate. I did use ChatGPT to come up with the fake users and fake posts. 

Some things weren't exactly in scope (photos, likes, comments, etc.), but as this is a social media application, I felt those things were implied.

## Some things I would have done if I had more time

* Tests with Vitest and RTL
* GitHub Actions running againt open PRs (Prettier formatting, linting, type checking, tests, etc.)
* A form to add a new post
* Incrementing/decrementing likes
* A form to add comments
* Displaying comments on a post
* Making it look better on larger screens (I went with a mobile-first approach that also looks decent enough on a large screen)

## Conclusion

I had a lot of fun with this project and I really wish I could have done some more, but I kept a hard time limit of two hours.
